I am a full time quantitative research consultant within OCP Solutions, working on solving large industrial problems. I am also passionate about Artificial intelligence in general, and currently working on various personal projects related to multi-agent reinforcement learning and real-time-bidding. My background includes financial mathematics, statistics and machine learning, and I will be interested by research opportunities within these fields, either be It in an industrial, financial, or academic institution.

Prior to joining OCP Solutions, I interned within JP Morgan's quantitative research team, focusing on FX Options derivatives, and graduated from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique) and [Sorbonne University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbonne_University)  majoring in financial mathematics. I also obtained a mathematical engineering degree from [Ecole des Mines de Nancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_des_mines_de_Nancy),  and completed two years of preparatory program (CPGE).

## For highschool students preparing IMO
We founded an organization Math&Maroc with previous International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) contestants to help you train for IMO, visit [www.mathemaroc.com](http://www.mathemaroc.com) for more informations.
You can in particular find courses I wrote on the publication section. [Here](http://www.mathemaroc.com/journal/MatheMarocNo3Vol12017.pdf) is one of them!


## For CPGE students
Here are some courses summaries I made that might help you: [Fiches de cours](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/Fiches de cours - Amine Bennouna.7z).
You can also find my prépa research report (TIPE) about Prince Rupert's Drop [here](MohammedAmine-Bennouna.github.io/La Goutte Du Prince Rupert - Dossier.pdf).
